	    Transformer AC Measurements
	    ---------------------------

From:  Bill's notebook 2018-11-21, has schematic

Purpose:
    To measure performance of the Talema 62020 Toroid transformer in step-up
    mode as driven by an LM675 power op-amp.

    Two data sets:
	d_open.tab	no load on transformer output
	d_cload.tab	Cl= 2 nF capacitor across output windings in series

    Imput is a single frequency sinusoid.

    Keep transformer output at 60 Vpeak across a single winding, thus
    keeping magnetic flux in the core constant at all frequency points.

    Current is measured by the voltage drop across a 10 ohm resistor in
    series with the primary.

    Sweep frequency 60 Hz to 4 kHz and measure voltages with oscilloscope.


Procedure:
    Amplifier input is a single frequency sinusoid from an Agilent 33522A
    function generator, which has 50 ohm output impedance.

    The op-amp output is AC coupled through a 220 uF, 100 V electrolytic
    capacitor to the transformeer high side.

    The function generator amplitude is adjusted to provide 60 Vpeak
    transformer output on a single winding.  Measurement of time delay
    (phase) is made with this output voltage signal as the reference
    (scope trigger).

    Oscilloscope measurements are made at points:  (AC coupled)
	Vin = input to amplifier
	Va  = high side of transformer.
	Vc  = low side of transformer, connected to Rc current resistor,
		which returns to the Vnn negative power supply.

	Measurement cursors were manualy positioned to read out peak
	voltage (Y1 cursor) and rising edge time delay (x1 cursor).
	Caution:  The trigger level must be zero (0 mV) on the AC sinusoid.
	The horizontal and vertical positions were also kept at zero,
	but may not be necessary as the cursors know where zero is.

    Measured parameters:
	f_Hz	frequency (Hz)
	Vs_Vpp	function generator amplitude setting (V peak-to-peak)
	Vin_mVp	op-amp input (mV peak)
	Va_Vp	high side of transformer (V peak)
	Vc_mVp  low  side of transformer (mV peak)
	Tc_us	time delay of Vc_mVp rise (us)
	Ta_us	time delay of Va_Vp  rise (us)
	Idc_mA  power supply meter current (mA DC)

Analysis:
    See R-script:  tranimeas

    All results are peak (not peak-to-peak).

    Parameter names are mostly systematic:
	First letter
	    I,V,P,Z  Current, Voltage, Power, Impedance
	Second letter - measurement point
	    c = at current measuring resistor Rc=10 ohm.
	    a = at transformer primary in series with Rc.
	    p = difference across transformer primary.
	Third letter - type of value
	    m = magnitude peak
	    p = phase
	    r = real part
	    i = imaginary part
	Units
	    _Vpp	V  peak-to-peak
	    _mVp	mV peak [probably should drop the p]
	    _mA		mA peak
	    _mW		mW peak
	    _deg	phase degrees
	    _rad	phase radians

    The essence of calculation is:  (R-script)

    # Read in data table
	df <- read.table( InFile, header=TRUE )

    # Period of sine wave
	Ts_us <- (1 / df$f_Hz) * 1e6

    # Phase of Vc
	Vcp_rad <- (df$Tc_us / Ts_us) * 2 * 3.14159

    # Phase of Va
	Vap_rad <- (df$Ta_us / Ts_us) * 2 * 3.14159

    # Let Vc (and Ic) be the reference aligned to the real axis.
	Va_rad = Vap_rad - Vcp_rad
	Vc_rad = Vcp_rad - Vcp_rad          # zero

    # Complex voltages
	Va_mVp <- df$Va_Vp * 1000
	Va <- complex( modulus=Va_mVp,    argument=Va_rad )
	Vc <- complex( modulus=df$Vc_mVp, argument=Vc_rad )

    # Primary voltage mV  (complex arithmetic)
	Vp <- Va - Vc

    # Primary current mA  (Rc= 10 ohm)
	Ic <- Vc / 10

    # Primary power mW  (1000 mW/W)
	Pp <- Vp * Ic / 1000

    # Primary impedance ohm
	Zp <- Vp / Ic

    # Model Zp as series R and C (or L)
	Rz = Re(Zp)
	Cz = -1 / ( 2 * 3.14 * df$f_Hz * Im(Zp) )
	Lz = Im(Zp) / ( 2 * 3.14 * df$f_Hz )


Limits:
    Ic_mA:  Winding current capacity.
	Transformer primary is rated at 357 mA each winding.  This is RMS,
	so for two parallel windings:
	357 mA * 2 * sqrt(2) = 1010 mA peak

    Ppr_mW:  Real power disapated in the transformer.

Summary data:
    The no-load "open" results represent transformer loss, which is quite
    large at these frequencies of interest (but not bad for a 60Hz power
    transformer).

    All for 60 Vpeak transformer output voltage.

    At f_Hz= 1000 Hz  nominal frequency:
		   open   2nF
	Vpm_mVp = 5097   5175	Primary voltage (peak)
	Ic_mA   =   73.0  108.0	Primary current (peak)
	Ppr_mW  =   89.7   71.2	Real power into transformer
	Zpm_ohm =   69.8   47.9	Primary impedance (magnitude)

	Note Ppr_mW went down with increasing 2nF load at 1000Hz - not sure why.

    At f_Hz= 2000 Hz
		  open    2nF
	Vpm_mVp = 5136   5156	Primary voltage (peak)
	Ic_mA   = 148.0  215.0	Primary current (peak)
	Ppr_mW  = 111.9  209.6	Real power into transformer
	Zpm_ohm =  34.7   24.0	Primary impedance (magnitude)

    Amplifier gain:  Gain = 10.3
	Fairly constant over all frequencies.

    Transformer gain:  TGain = 11.6
	Fairly constant over all frequencies.

    Primary impedance - effective capacitance.
		  open    2nF
	Cz_uF   = -2.2   -3.3
	Fairly constant over frequencies 250 Hz to 2000 Hz.
	Not sure why the value is negative.  [Computing Zc = 1/(j*w*C), and
	Im(Zp) is positive, so C = -1/(w*Im(Zc)) is negative.]

	The load impedance Cl= 2nF is transformed to the primary by the
	turns ratio squared.
	TGain = 11.6 transformer voltage gain for one winding, is the
	    half the turns ratio.
	Nr = 2 * TGain = 23.2
	Cp = Nr**2 * Cl = 23.2**2 * 2nF  = 1.1 uF

	The change in Cz_uF from open to 2nF load is also 1.1 uF as predicted.
	Interesting!
	
	It looks like the transformer primary appears capacitive at
	frequencies over 250 Hz.

	Could the transformer be self resonant around 125 Hz?  There is a
	fairly large phase shift at the low frequencies.


Extrapolating to full output voltage:

    Using worst case 2nF load and f_Hz=2000

    To reach 120 Vpeak output, double the input voltage (and current),
    which is 4x the power.
	Vpm_mVp = 1030 mV
	Ic_mA   =  430 mA
	Ppr_mW  =  840 mW

    To reach 240 Vpeak output, 4x the input voltage (and current),
    which is 16x the power.
	Vpm_mVp = 2060 mV
	Ic_mA   =  860 mA
	Ppr_mW  = 3400 mW

    This is within the 1000 mA peak winding current.
    All the power will be dissapated in the transformer as loss.
    At 3.4 Watts, it may get a little too hot, will need to monitor.
    I feel 1 watt heat dissapation should be totally manageable.
    Try it and see.

    Core eddy current loss is proportional to the square of frequency.
    The plot of real power seems to fit this:
	scatter.smooth( dg$f_Hz, dg$Ppr_mW )
    Keep frequency down to avoid.

    At 1000 Hz full voltage 240 Vpeak estimate
	Ppr_mW = 1400 mW

    A smaller current resistor Rc= 2 ohm will be needed for full output
    voltage.  This resistor is also essential to help op-amp stability
    driving capacitive loads.


Conclusions:

    The system was operable from 60 Hz to 2 kHz with 60 Vpeak output on
    one transformer winding, staying within current and power limits
    of all components.  It works!

    Extrapolating to 240 Vpeak output looks feasable as an upper limit.
    At 2 kHz frequency, the primary current of 860 mA and real power of
    3.4 W dissapated in the transformer looks manageable.
    At 1 kHz real power less than 1 W should be very manageable.
    Need to try it and see.

    Thus it looks suitable as a high-voltage sinusoid piezo tube driver.
