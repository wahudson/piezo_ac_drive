## Basic Idea
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Use a power transformer in step-up voltage mode.
    i.e.  20:1 voltage ratio.
    25 Vpp input give 500 Vpp output.

    Two identical channels will be used to drive the X and Y electrode pairs
    of the piezo tube.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## General Requirements.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Load:
    PiCeramic.com  model PT230.94 piezo tube.
    Piezo tube electrodes are the load, purely capacitive.
    The two electrodes in a complementary pair are 2.1 nF each, with
    a maximum voltage of +-250 V (+-500 V across the pair).  Peak voltage.

    The two electrode capacitors are in series (to the inner tube electrode),
    and thus the combined capacitance is (2.1 nF / 2).

    Nominal:  1 nF capacitive load.  This is the design point.
    Range:    2 nF maximum, opportunistic at lower voltage or frequency.

Frequency range:  Sinusoidal
    Nominal:  1 kHz
    Range:  0.5 kHz to 2 kHz
    This is suitable for a 1 second frame rate.

IS constant frequency, once resonance is found.

NOT flat frequency response.  But it would be nice.
    We can adjust input amplitude as we change frequency.

NOT DC capable.
    Since we operate the fiber scanner at resonance of the fiber, we
    never go down to DC.

Objective of the first version is to prove the concept and operate at
    the nominal point.  Then refine the design to operate over a wider
    range if necessary.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Detail Schematic
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

General concept is a LM675 power op-amp driving the low-voltage side
of a power transformer to step up voltage to 500 Vpp.

Work backward from the load to the input.

Transformer:  T1

    The output is center tapped to provide a ground reference.
    The two piezo electrodes are equal capacitance (nominal 2.1 nF).
    By symmetry, the piezo inner electrode is then at virtual ground.

    Consider the transformer as ideal for initial design purposes.
    Use a toroidal transformer for lowest leakage inductance.

	-- Talema Group LLC
	Open toroid, long leads.  Dual primary and secondary.

	* Note:  we redefine Primary as the low-voltage side, and
	Secondary as the high-voltage side, to fit our application.
	The Primary is the driven side.

    This transformer is spec'ed as a 60Hz power transformer.
    We intend to operate it outside of this application space, and we
    accept whatever attributes it has when we do so.
    Audio (vacuum tube) transformers are essentially a glorified power
    transformer, and they operate at these voltages from 70 Hz to 15 kHz.

    Current rating:
    Our capacitive load results in quite low currents, even at f= 10 kHz.

    The turns ratio is
	Nr = Ns / Np
	    Ns = secondary turns
	    Np = primary turns
	Nr > 1  is step up;  Nr < 1  is step down.

    The dual secondaries (high-side windings) are connected in series to
    provide a center tap.

    The dual primaries (low-side windings) are connected in parallel to
    give the largest turns ratio.

    The turns ratio is the ratio of Secondary voltage to the Primary
    voltage at no load:
	Nr = Vs / Vp
	    Vs = 230 V  (series)   secondary voltage
	    Vp = 9.7 V  (parallel)   primary voltage
	Nr = 23.7  +-0.3
	Nr^2 = 562    impedance transformation factor (turns ratio squared)

Primary Voltage:  Vp

    Is a single frequency sinusoid.

    Vs = Nr * Vp	secondary voltage
    Secondary voltage is determined by max load voltage
    Vs = 500 Vpeak  = 354 Vrms max

    Vp = Vs / Nr
       = (500 Vpeak) / 23.7
    Vp = 21.1 Vpeak = 14.9 Vrms max

Primary Load:  Cp

    We use this as the load the op-amp sees.

    The load impedance (Cs = 1 nF) is transformed to the primary by
	Cp = ((Nr)**2) * Cs
	Cp = 560 nF

    The capacitive reactance is
	Xp = 1 / ( 2*Pi * f * Cp )
	    Pi = 3.14
	    f  = frequency
	Xp = 284 ohm  at f= 1kHz
	     142 ohm  at f= 2kHz

    The Primary Current Ip at maximum Vs is 
	Ip = Vp / Xp
	   = 14.9 Vrms / 284 ohm  =  52 mArms   at f= 1kHz
	   = 14.9 Vrms / 142 ohm  = 105 mArms   at f= 2kHz

	Note we are neglecting the primary current required to create
	the magnetic flux in the transformer core.
	In an ideal transformer it depends only on the primary inductance
	(with secondary open) and the primary voltage.  [2]

AC coupling capacitor:  Co

    The magnetic core of a transformer will saturate if a DC voltage is
    applied across any coil.

    Thus we use an AC coupling capacitor, labled Co.
    Its impedance should be at least 100x lower than the load for a 1%
    loss.
    Choose a 220 uF capacitor (a common value).
	Co / Cp = 220 uF / 560 nF = 293
    This looks like a good enough ratio.

    Choose an electrolytic capacitor, which is polarized.  Non-polar
    capacitors are not common in this value range.

    To be sure the capacitor is not reverse biased, we connect the
    low side of the transformer primary to Vnn, the op-amp negative
    supply.  The op-amp can only output voltages greater than Vnn.
    [Connecting to ground would also work for signal coupling, but
    will reverse bias the capacitor.]

    Voltage rating:  100 V (is common).
    The op-amp maximum supply is +-30 V (60 V to Vnn).  The capacior
    should be able to withstand this voltage as a minimum.  Usually
    choose a capacitor working voltage around 2x the maximum expected
    voltage.

    Ripple current rating:
    Is an important parameter for a coupling capacitor as well as a
    filter capacitor.  I choose one with a high ripple current rating,
    even though a lesser rating probably would be acceptable.
    But see "Short Circuit Protection" below.

    Capacitor  220 uF, 100 V, +-20%  Electrolytic
	Ripple current:  1.134 A @ 120Hz,  1.62 A @ 100 kHz
	Impedance:  47 mOhm
	Size:  0.492" Dia, 1.063" L
	Lifetime:  10000 Hrs at 105 C

Output Resistor:  Ro

    Most power amplifiers do not drive highly capacitive loads well,
    i.e they ring or oscillate.
    A way to help is to add a resistor, at least 1 ohm, in series with
    the output.

    The LM675 datasheet application hints:
    It can drive up to 2 uF.
    The square wave response will exhibit ringing with more than 0.1 uF
    and no series resistance.

    A series resistor will add a voltage drop on the output.  We can
    tolerate this, since we generally operate at constant frequency and
    constant capacitive load (and thus constant output current), and we
    can adjust input signal to compensate.

    Nominal voltage drop:
    Vro = Ip * Ro
        = ( 52 mArms) * 10 ohm  = 0.52 Vrms   at f= 1kHz
        = (105 mArms) * 10 ohm  = 1.05 Vrms   at f= 2kHz

    Nominal power:  (but see "Short Circuit Protection")
    Pro = Ip * Vro
        = 105 mArms * 1.05 Vrms = 0.11 Wrms   at f= 2kHz

Op-amp Gain:  R1, Rf

    The LM675 datasheet examples show resistor values in 1k to 10k ohm range.
    It is internally compensated for gains of 10 or greater.

    Choose gain of 10.
    For Vp = 21.1 Vpeak, input Vi= 2.1 Vpeak.

    Choose R1= 1 kohm, Rf= 9.1 kohm
    Non-inverting amplifier configuration, gain
    G = 1 + (Rf / R1)
      = 1 + (9.1 kohm / 1 kohm)  = 10.1

Input Signal:  Ri

    The input is DC coupled for simplicity of design, but it should have
    no DC offset.

    Ri Input load resistor to ground.
    This is to prevent the input from floating when no signal source is
    connected.
    Choose  Ri = 22 kohm, as in the datasheet.

    Possible input features:  (after initial prototype)

    a) Provide AC input coupling.  This would mainly avoid any DC offset
    multiplied by the gain shifting the op-amp output toward one supply
    rail or the other and thus possibly clipping.

    b) An input low-pass filter.  Use to prevent too high an input frequency
    creating excessive current.

Power Supplies:

    The LM675 op-amp can have supplies from +-8 V to +-30 V.
    Nominal +-24 V should allow maximum output of 500 Vpeak.
    Probably start with +-15 V, since that is fairly common.
    Use lab power supply to start.

Power up sequencing and transients:

    Initially we should bring up the supplies first, then apply signal.

    A fast transient on the transformer input will probably generate a
    high- voltage spike on the output.
    We should observe prototype circuit transients, and be sure they
    do not exceed any breakdown voltage limits.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Short Circuit Protection
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is possible that the piezo tube electrode contacts become short
    circuited thru various accidents.
    If that happens, we do not want the driver electronics damaged.

    When the transformer output is shorted (i.e. zero ohm load), that
    low impedance is reflected into the primary, which then also
    appears shorted.
    The op-amp output and all series components (i.e. Ro, Co, and
    transformer primary winding) must be able to handle the resulting
    current and corresponding power dissapation.

    In short circuit condition, the current is limited by what the
    op-amp can drive.
    Examine the current (power) handling ability of each component.

    Transformer primary:
    Its application rating is 357 mA (rms) at full load.  This is likely
    an application power limit, and not the wire current limit.
    We want to keep transformer power below the 5 Watt rating.
    At our max primary voltage Vp:
        5 W / 14.9 Vrms  = 336 mArms  = max Ip allowed

    Coupling Capacitor:  Co
    Max ripple current is 1.134 Arms.

    Output Resistor:  Ro
    Normal power is (105 mArms)^2 * (10 ohm) = 0.11 Wrms.
    It is limited by power dissapation.  Assume all voltage is dropped
    accross it (worst case).
    P = V^2 / R  = ((15 Vrms)^2) / 10 ohm  = 22.5 Wrms
    I = V   / R  = 15 Vrms / 10 ohm        = 1.5 Arms
    Note this current is too high for the transformer rating, so we
    cannot rely only on the resistor limiting current.

    Op-amp:  LM675
    The LM675 op-amp can drive up to 3 A at full voltage.
    It does have built-in thermal shutdown and fixed current limit.

    Thus transformer current is really the limiting factor.

    Protection mechanisms:
    A) Fuse
	+ Pretty reliable protection.
	- Replacing blown fuses is annoying.
    B) Limit op-amp supply current.
	+ Simple.
	- How does op-amp behaive at low supply voltages?
    C) Use Op-amp with adjustable current limit.
	+ Direct control.
	- Cost more.  Not in LM675

Protection Solution choosen:
    Do all of this.

    Fuse:  F1
    Choose 250 mA fuse.
    Is well above nominal operating current of 105 mArms.
    Is well below transformer power limit   of 336 mArms.

    Power supply current limit:
    This is the max power under fault conditions until fuse blows.
    The same supply will likely power two channels (X and Y drive).
    Limit power supply current to 500 mA.

    Output resistor:  Ro
    Use 10 ohms to help limit current.
    Choose power rating to handle the max supply current (500 mA).
    P = I^2 * R  = (500 mA)^2 * 10 ohm = 2.5 W
    Choose 5 W rating (twice the expected power).

    This initial design is experimental - for attended operation only.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Transformer Voltage rating:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Transformers are specified in RMS (root mean square), which is average
    power for a sinusoidal waveform.
	Vpeak = sqrt( 2 ) * Vrms
    The high side voltage as spec'ed is 230 Vrms, which is 325 Vpeak.
    The isolation voltage between primary and secondary is rated at 4 kV.
    
    The Talema transformer does not specify the insulation strength between
    the two primary coils (an Amgis transformer did specify 0.5 kV AC).

    A transformer connected to the power mains must tolerate the transient
    overvoltages which are normal in a Mains circuit, typically 1000 V.
    Our application is isolated from the Power Mains, and thus can use the
    full insulation electric strength as the working voltage.  [1]

    Thus we expect the transformer high side should be good to 500 Vpeak,
    but we must accept whatever it ends up being.  The worst that happens
    is an internal short within the high-side coil, reducing its
    effectiveness.  At 500 Vpeak, there should be no short to the core or
    to the low side coil, since that is specified to withstand 4 kV.

    Thus I think we are safe to operate the high-side coil to 500 Vpeak
    (the max piezo tube voltage), and there should be no safety hazard
    even if the high-side coil insulation does breakdown.

    Insulation breakdown probably results in a pinhole, possibly shorting
    the wire coil, or creating a little spark gap that conducts when the
    AC sine wave reaches a high enough voltage.  The transformer is thus
    generally ruined.

    We could conduct a high-potential test between the windings.
