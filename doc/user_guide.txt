    Limit heat sink temperature rise to 50 degC.
    The LM675 op-amp has internal over-temperature shutdown.
    The heat sink is rated 4.7 degC/W heat sink to ambient.

Operating principle:
    Power OpAmp driving a step-up transformer.  See schematic.

Danger!

    Output connectors rated 300V only for hands-free use.
    Disable AC signal input before operating output connectors.

Caution!
    Laboratory prototype unit.
    User must observe limits to avoid damage.
    Transformer output is floating, option to ground center tap.

## User Guide
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input/Power Sequencing:
    Recomend turn ON power supplies first, then apply Input signal.
    Reverse order when powering down.

    The positive and negative power supplies can be applied in either order.

    The LM675 op-amp is not rated for input voltage exceeding power supply
    voltage.  Although this happens when the power supply is OFF and the input
    signal is still applied, no damage seems to result.
    Use a 50 ohm output impedance (or greater) signal source to help limit
    input current in this condition.

High Voltage Output disable:
    The best way is to disable the input signal, leaving the power ON.
    With no input signal, the transformer output is zero, and there is
    no high voltage anywhere in the device.  The transformer coil resistance
    will discharge any capacitance on the output.

    Connectors have a limited number of mating cycles before they become
    unreliable.  Avoid using them to disable the output.

    Often the function generator signal source has an output disable feature.

    Powering down is not recommended, as it aggravates input/power sequencing
    issues.

Output Amplitude monitor:
    Use an AC Voltmeter to measure RMS (Root Mean Square) voltage.  Many
    meters are rated for frequencies to 10 kHz or 100 kHz.  Two ways:

    A) Measure input voltage and multiply by Gain= 120 to get output voltage.

    B) Measure output voltage directly.  CAUTION:  Disable output while
    connecting meter, or use appropriate probes.
    Typically measure from transformer center tap (Black+Red) to either output.
    Measuring accross both outputs (Yellow - Violet) will give twice the
    voltage, e.g. 480 Vpeak (340 Vrms).

Transformer Output:
    The transformer output winding is naturally isolated (floating).
    It can be optionally grounded in various ways - inspect the device to
    see what was done.  Two options:
    A) When floating, the load determines the ground reference, which
	should be roughly mid-way between the differential outputs.
    B) Ground the transformer center tap (Black+Red) to provide a
	ground-referenced differential output.
    Version v5 was designed for differential output, and grounding one side
    may exceed insulation voltage ratings.

Input signal:
    Caution when using a function generator with output amplitude setting
    corrected for 50-ohm/High-Z load.  Use the High-Z load setting.
    Using the 50-ohm setting will double the function generator output
    voltage, as the 50 ohm load (forming a voltage divider) is not present.

Power Dissipation:
    Quiescent power supply current (with no input signal) should be
	Isupply < 55 mA.

    Virtually all the input power (from DC power supply) is dissipated in
    the op-amps.  This factor of 2 is from +V = -V (bipolar) supplies.  The
    current Isupply should be roughly the same for both +V and -V supplies.
	P = (2 * Vsupply) * Isupply  = total power, both amplifiers
    Keep each amplifier below 14 W.
    (Total 28 W only if both amplifiers are driven the same.)

    Power dissipation can be reduced by lowering the power supply voltage.
    However, allow 3 V headroom for op-amp peak output voltage below power
    supply voltage:
	Vo_max <= Vsupply - 3 V
    Check output for clipping with an oscilloscope.

Heat Sink Temperature:
    Heat sinks are electrically isolated.
    Expected heat sink temperature rise (delta T) is roughly:  (best case)
	dT = 72 degC  at 14 W
	dT = 50 degC  at 10 W

    You can cautiously check heat sink temperature by hand.  Use the back
    of your finger, as it is more sensitive, holding it in the air above
    the heat sink.  If that feels too hot, don't touch it.

Thermal Shutdown:
    The LM675 op-amp will shut down at 150 degC junction temperature.
    If the output shuts down, check heatsink temperature and reduce
    operating conditions.
    It will cycle on again as temperature drops to 145 degC.
    Avoid thermal shutdown cycling as the stress reduces reliability.

Output Connector Cable:
    Cable is Cat5e, rated 300 Vrms, shielded, with two twisted pairs.
    pins 1, 4:   shield connected to both pins
    pins 2, 3:   orange, orange-white  twisted
    pins 5, 6:   blue,   blue-white    twisted
