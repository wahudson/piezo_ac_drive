Idea:  Use an inductor to cancel piezo tube capacitance at the frequency
    we are operating.  Not at resonance.  This may help the driver amplifier.
    Series L, parallel C, low-pass configuration.
    We are using a fixed, narrow, frequency.

    Matching network at series resonance of the transducer.
    Using an LC low-pass form of matching network (i.e. series L, followed by
    parallel C to ground).  Effectively cancelling the imaginary part of
    the load impedance at resonance.  The overall impedance is lowered by
    a factor of 10 (2000 ohm to 200 ohm).
    The transducer power is maximum at resonance, and is about 5 times
    greater with the matching network.
    The 800 kHz transducer has BVD (Butterworth-Van-Dyke model) parameters:
	Rs= 1.8 kohm, Ls= 1.6 mH, Cs= 26 pF, Co= 65 pF
	Matching network:  Lm= 58.8 uH, Cm= 588 pF
	Agilent 4294A Precision Impedance Analyzer.
    Note the matching capacitance Cm is 10x the transducer capacitance Co,
    which explains why the overall impedance is 10x lower.
    Ultrasonic transducers are typically operated at resonance, it seems.
